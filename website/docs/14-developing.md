# Developing

Obtain the latest development copy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/siddharthvp/mwn.git
cd mwn
npm install		# install dependencies
```

Build: run `npm run build`. This generates the JS files in `build` from the TypeScript sources in `src`. You may want to configure your IDE to do this automatically on every code change.

### Tests

Mwn has a comprehensive test suite that uses [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) runner and [chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) for expectations. Tests should be added for all bug fixes and feature changes. There are three types of tests:

1. Tests that don't require a wiki: `npm run test:nowiki`
2. Tests that are based on [testwiki](https://test.wikipedia.org/): `npm run test:testwiki`

You need to setup botpassword login credentials for testwiki to run these tests. Create a `.auth.js` file in repository root, with this structure:

```json
{
  "username": "",
  "password": ""
}
```

No edits (or any other type of write action) will be done on testwiki. The credentials are only for reading content.

3. Tests that require a local wiki: `npm run test:localwiki`

For these, you need to spin up a local MediaWiki installation:

- Ensure that you have docker and docker-compose installed. If you're using Windows, you need to use WSL 2 and follow the steps at <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/> to link Docker Desktop to WSL.
- Run `npm run setuplocalwiki`

If all goes well, you should now have a wiki up and running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Sign in with username `Wikiuser` and password `wikipassword` (See [the setup.sh script](https://github.com/siddharthvp/mwn/blob/master/tests/docker/setup.sh) for other setup details.)

All tests except the ones that depend on testwiki will also be run automatically via GitHub Actions when you create a PR, so no worries if you're having trouble with local MW installation.

### Documentation

When adding new features, please also update the corresponding documentation in `website/docs`. Documentation can be previewed by running `npm run docs` which starts a server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) that updates the rendered docs live as they are edited.

The docs are hosted on <https://mwn.toolforge.org> and generated via [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Build and deployment take place via GitHub Actions whenever they're updated in the master branch.
